## Solution Architecture
### Database Integration
**PostgreSQL for Data Management**  
The system leverages PostgreSQL as the main relational database to store and manage structured data for orders, inventory, and logistics. Here’s an example of the schema used to capture key supply chain metrics:
```sql
CREATE TABLE company_metrics (
    Sno INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Company_Name VARCHAR(255),
    SCM_Practices VARCHAR(255),
    Supplier_Count INT,
    Inventory_Turnover_Ratio DECIMAL(10, 2),
    Lead_Time_days INT,
    Order_Fulfillment_Rate_percent INT,
    Customer_Satisfaction_percent INT,
    Technology_Utilized VARCHAR(255),
    Environmental_Impact_Score INT,
    Supply_Chain_Agility VARCHAR(255),
    Supplier_Lead_Time_Variability_days INT,
    Inventory_Accuracy_percent INT,
    Transportation_Cost_Efficiency_percent INT,
    Supply_Chain_Integration_Level VARCHAR(255),
    Sustainability_Practices VARCHAR(255),
    Supply_Chain_Complexity_Index VARCHAR(20),
    COGS INT,
    Operational_Efficiency_Score INT,
    Revenue_Growth_Rate_out_of_15 INT,
    Supply_Chain_Risk_percent INT,
    Supplier_Collaboration_Level VARCHAR(255),
    Supply_Chain_Resilience_Score INT,
    Supplier_Relationship_Score INT,
    Total_Implementation_Cost INT
);
```

## Redis for Fast Data Access
Redis is used for caching preprocessed or frequently accessed data like inventory levels, delivery routes, and profit margins. This ensures fast retrieval of essential data.
```python
import redis
import psycopg2
# Connect to Redis
redis_client = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
# Connect to PostgreSQL
conn = psycopg2.connect(dbname="mcf_database", user="user", password="password", host="localhost")
cur = conn.cursor()
# Example: Fetching real-time inventory data from Redis, or if not available, fetch from PostgreSQL
def get_inventory_data(product_id):
    inventory_data = redis_client.get(f"inventory:{product_id}")
    if not inventory_data:
        cur.execute("SELECT inventory_count FROM products WHERE product_id = %s", (product_id,))
        inventory_data = cur.fetchone()[0]
        redis_client.set(f"inventory:{product_id}", inventory_data)  # Cache the result in Redis
    return inventory_data
```

## AI Integration and Predictive Features
### AI-Powered Stock Redistribution and Demand Prediction
Sequential Neural Networks (such as LSTM or GRU) are used for demand prediction and stock redistribution. The models analyze historical data to predict future demand and adjust inventory accordingly.
#### Example Code for LSTM Model:
```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
# Assuming historical demand data is loaded as a numpy array
demand_data = np.array([/* historical sales data */])
# Preprocessing (Scaling the data)
scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1))
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(demand_data.reshape(-1, 1))
# Define the LSTM model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(scaled_data.shape[1], 1)),
    tf.keras.layers.LSTM(50),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
# Fit the model on training data
model.fit(scaled_data, scaled_data, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
# Predict future demand
predicted_demand = model.predict(scaled_data[-30:])  # Predict the next 30 days
